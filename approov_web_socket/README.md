# approov_web_socket

An Approov websocket implementation for Dart to fit the needs of the Approov Mobile security solution.

This package is a dependency of the `phoenix_wings` package, that on its turn is a dependency of the `absinthe_socket` package that is required on the [Approov Flutter GraphQL Quickstart](https://github.com/approov/quickstart-flutter-graphql).

# Approov Flutter Packages

Approov Flutter Packages based on existing code or packages, adding Approov-specific modifications. These are collected in this repository to keep code that is predominantly created by others separate from the CriticalBlue code base.

An example usage of these packages can be found on the [Approov Flutter GraphQL Quickstart](https://github.com/approov/quickstart-flutter-graphql).
